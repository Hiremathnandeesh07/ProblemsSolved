[https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/)

The **next greater element** of some element `x` in an array is the **first greater** element that is **to the right** of `x` in the same array.

You are given two **distinct 0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`.

For each `0 <= i < nums1.length`, find the index `j` such that `nums1[i] == nums2[j]` and determine the **next greater element** of `nums2[j]` in `nums2`. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is `-1`.

Return _an array_ `ans` _of length_ `nums1.length` _such that_ `ans[i]` _is the **next greater element** as described above._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[4,1,2\], nums2 = \[1,3,4,2\]
**Output:** \[-1,3,-1\]
**Explanation:** The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = \[1,3,4,2\]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = \[1,3,4,2\]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = \[1,3,4,2\]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[2,4\], nums2 = \[1,2,3,4\]
**Output:** \[3,-1\]
**Explanation:** The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = \[1,2,3,4\]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = \[1,2,3,4\]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.





### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a stack to keep track of the next greater elements as we iterate through `nums2`. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. **Stack and Map:** Use a stack to keep track of the elements for which we haven't found the next greater element yet. Use a map to store the next greater element for each element in `nums2`.
    
2. **Traverse `nums2` in Reverse Order:** Iterate through `nums2` from right to left. For each element:
    
    - Pop elements from the stack until the top of the stack is greater than the current element (the top of the stack is the next greater element for the current element).
    - If the stack is not empty, the next greater element for the current element is on the top of the stack.
    - Push the current element onto the stack.
    - Store the next greater element in the map.
3. **Build the Result:** Iterate through `nums1` and use the map to build the result array, using -1 if a next greater element does not exist.
    

### Solution in C++

Here is the implementation of the above approach in C++:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <stack>

std::vector<int> nextGreaterElement(std::vector<int>& nums1, std::vector<int>& nums2) {
    // Map to store the next greater element for each number in nums2
    std::unordered_map<int, int> nextGreater;
    // Stack to keep track of elements for which we are finding the next greater element
    std::stack<int> st;
    
    // Traverse nums2 from right to left
    for (int i = nums2.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        int current = nums2[i];
        // Pop elements from the stack that are less than or equal to the current element
        while (!st.empty() && st.top() <= current) {
            st.pop();
        }
        // If stack is not empty, the top element is the next greater element for the current element
        nextGreater[current] = st.empty() ? -1 : st.top();
        // Push the current element onto the stack
        st.push(current);
    }
    
    // Result vector to store the next greater elements for nums1
    std::vector<int> result;
    for (int num : nums1) {
        result.push_back(nextGreater[num]);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```


### Explanation of the Code

- **Data Structures:**
    
    - `unordered_map<int, int> nextGreater`: Stores the next greater element for each element in `nums2`.
    - `std::stack<int> st`: Helps in finding the next greater element.
- **Traversal:**
    
    - Iterate `nums2` from right to left.
    - Use the stack to find the next greater element efficiently.
- **Building Result:**
    
    - For each element in `nums1`, fetch the next greater element from the map and build the result vector.

This solution efficiently finds the next greater elements using a single pass through `nums2` with the help of a stack, resulting in a time complexity of O(n)O(n)O(n), where nnn is the length of `nums2`. The space complexity is also O(n)O(n)O(n) due to the usage of the stack and the map.

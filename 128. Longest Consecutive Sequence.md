128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

## Solution :

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_set<int> myset;

        // Insert all elements from nums into the unordered_set
        for (const auto& elem : nums) {
            myset.insert(elem);
        }

        int maxcount = 0;

        for (const auto& value : myset) {
            if (myset.find(value - 1) == myset.end()) {
                // value is the start of a sequence
                int newvalue = value + 1;
                int count = 1; // Start counting from the current value itself
                while (myset.find(newvalue) != myset.end()) {
                    // Increment count for consecutive elements
                    ++count;
                    ++newvalue;
                }
                // Update maxcount if necessary
                maxcount = max(maxcount, count);
            }
        }

        return maxcount;
    }
};
```

[https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/)

Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1. **Whitespace**: Ignore any leading whitespace (`" "`).
2. **Signedness**: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is `'-'` or `'+'`, assuming positivity is neither present.
3. **Conversion**: Read the integer by skipping leading zerosÂ until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
4. **Rounding**: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup> - 1]`, then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-2<sup>31</sup>` should be rounded to `-2<sup>31</sup>`, and integers greater than `2<sup>31</sup> - 1` should be rounded to `2<sup>31</sup> - 1`.

Return the integer as the final result.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "42"

**Output:** 42

**Explanation:**

The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
^
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
^
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
^

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = " -042"

**Output:** \-42

**Explanation:**

Step 1: " \-042" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
^
Step 2: " \-042" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
^
Step 3: " -042" ("042" is read in, leading zeros ignored in the result)
^

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "1337c0d3"

**Output:** 1337

**Explanation:**

Step 1: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
^
Step 2: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
^
Step 3: "1337c0d3" ("1337" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
^

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s = "0-1"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

Step 1: "0-1" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
^
Step 2: "0-1" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
^
Step 3: "0\-1" ("0" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
^

**Example 5:**

**Input:** s = "words and 987"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

Reading stops at the first non-digit character 'w'.

### answer

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <climits> // For INT_MAX and INT_MIN

class Solution {
public:
    int myAtoi(string s) {
        int i = 0;
        int sign = 1;
        long long num = 0; // Change data type to long long to handle INT_MIN correctly

        // Skip leading whitespaces
        while (i < s.length() && s[i] == ' ')
            i++;

        // Handle sign
        if (s[i] == '-') {
            sign = -1;
            i++;
        } else if (s[i] == '+') {
            i++;
        }

        // Convert string to integer
        while (i < s.length() && s[i] >= '0' && s[i] <= '9') {
            // Handle overflow before updating num
            if (num * 10 + (s[i] - '0') > INT_MAX) { // Use long long to avoid overflow
                return (sign == -1) ? INT_MIN : INT_MAX;
            }
            num = num * 10 + (s[i] - '0');
            i++;
        }

        return sign * num;
    }
};
```

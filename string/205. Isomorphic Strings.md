Given two strings `s` and `t`, _determine if they are isomorphic_.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "egg", t = "add"
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "foo", t = "bar"
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "paper", t = "title"
**Output:** true

### answer

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map> // for std::unordered_map

class Solution {
public:
    bool isIsomorphic(std::string s, std::string t) {
        // Check if the lengths of the two strings are different
        if (s.length() != t.length()) {
            return false; // If different lengths, they cannot be isomorphic
        }

        // Two unordered maps to store mappings from s to t and from t to s
        std::unordered_map<char, char> map_s_to_t;
        std::unordered_map<char, char> map_t_to_s;

        // Loop through each character in the strings
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char char_s = s[i]; // Current character in s
            char char_t = t[i]; // Corresponding character in t

            // Check if there is a mapping from s to t for char_s
            if (map_s_to_t.find(char_s) != map_s_to_t.end()) {
                // If char_s is already mapped to a different character in t, return false
                if (map_s_to_t[char_s] != char_t) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                // If char_s is not mapped yet, establish a new mapping
                map_s_to_t[char_s] = char_t;
            }

            // Check if there is a mapping from t to s for char_t
            if (map_t_to_s.find(char_t) != map_t_to_s.end()) {
                // If char_t is already mapped to a different character in s, return false
                if (map_t_to_s[char_t] != char_s) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                // If char_t is not mapped yet, establish a new mapping
                map_t_to_s[char_t] = char_s;
            }
        }

        // If no contradictions were found, the strings are isomorphic
        return true;
    }
};

## explain me the "short" and "long" datatypes

In programming, the `short` and `long` data types are used to define integers with different ranges of values:

- **`short`**:
    
    - It is a smaller integer type, usually 16 bits in size.
    - It can store values ranging from -32,768 to 32,767 for signed `short`.
    - It's useful when memory is a concern and you know the values will fit within this range.
- **`long`**:
    
    - It is a larger integer type, typically 32 or 64 bits depending on the system.
    - For 32-bit `long`, it can store values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 for signed `long`.
    - It is used when you need to store larger integer values that a `short` or regular `int` can't handle.

These types help optimize memory usage and processing speed by allowing programmers to choose the appropriate size for their data.


## even int stores 4bytes. then what is the use of using long


You're correct that on many systems, both `int` and `long` can be 4 bytes (32 bits) in size, particularly in older 32-bit architectures. However, there are a few key differences and use cases:

1. **Extended Range on 64-bit Systems**:
    
    - On 64-bit systems, `long` is often 8 bytes (64 bits) instead of 4 bytes. This gives `long` a much larger range, making it suitable for storing very large integers that exceed the capacity of a 4-byte `int`.
2. **Portability**:
    
    - In some programming languages, especially C and C++, the exact size of `int` and `long` can vary depending on the platform (32-bit vs. 64-bit systems). By using `long`, you can ensure that your code is more likely to work with larger numbers on systems where `int` is still 4 bytes but `long` is 8 bytes.
3. **Historical Context**:
    
    - Historically, the distinction was more important on older architectures where memory and processing power were more limited. `int` was often chosen for standard operations, while `long` was reserved for cases where larger numbers were required.
4. **Code Clarity**:
    
    - Using `long` explicitly can make your code clearer, indicating that you expect to work with larger numbers, even if the current architecture gives `int` and `long` the same size. This can help future-proof your code.

In summary, while `int` and `long` may be the same size on some systems, `long` can offer more range on 64-bit systems and is useful for writing more portable and clear code.

```python
You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.



Example 1:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
```

````cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canPlaceFlowers(std::vector<int>& flowerbed, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < flowerbed.size(); ++i) {
            if (flowerbed[i] == 0 &&
                (i == 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] == 0) &&
                (i == flowerbed.size() - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] == 0)) {
                flowerbed[i] = 1;
                count++;
            }
        }
        if (count >= n) {
    return true;
} else {
    return false;
}

    }
};```

```cpp
SOME MORE EXPLANATION
Certainly! Let's break down the condition if (flowerbed[i] == 0 && (i == 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] == 0) && (i == flowerbed.size() - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] == 0)) in detail:

flowerbed[i] == 0: This part checks if the current plot (at index i) in the flowerbed is empty. The value 0 typically represents an empty plot.

(i == 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] == 0): This part ensures that the current plot is either the first plot in the flowerbed (index 0) or the plot immediately before it is empty. This condition ensures that the first plot in the flowerbed can be considered as a valid place to plant a flower since there's no plot before it to check.

(i == flowerbed.size() - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] == 0): This part ensures that the current plot is either the last plot in the flowerbed or the plot immediately after it is empty. Similar to the previous condition, this ensures that the last plot in the flowerbed can be considered as a valid place to plant a flower since there's no plot after it to check.

In summary, this condition checks if the current plot in the flowerbed is empty (flowerbed[i] == 0) and both adjacent plots (if they exist) are also empty. If these conditions are met, it means that a flower can be planted in the current plot without violating the rule that flowers must be planted in adjacent empty plots. ```
